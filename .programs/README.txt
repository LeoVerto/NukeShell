This is the actualy program directory, as some programs in the public program directory just ask for 
user input and redirect to the actualy programs in this directory.

This system is used to prevent rather unadvanced users from acciedently editing important system files or 
messing up stuff.

Congratulations for finding this directory, you are much smarter than [insert other user's name here]!
